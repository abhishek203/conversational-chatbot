Phase 1 : Learning Phase(3 weeks)
        I learnt basics of machine learning, implemented gradient descent in python and understood the concepts involved.
        Learnt deep learning from online resources and textbooks.
        Understood how neural networks work, learnt feed forward neural nets and back propagation.
        Learnt concepts and uploaded the notes in git.
        Learnt aboubt natural language processing i.e., tokenization, embedding and about Reccurant neural nets, GRU and LSTM.
        Learnt how to implement these in tensorflow using keras api.
        
Phase 2 : Preprocessing(1 week)
        Collected the dataset, worked on preprocessing the dataset.
        Implented programs to convert speech to text and text to speech.
        
Phase 3 : Making and saving model(2 weeks)
        Learnt sequence to sequence modeling in natural language processing and implemented Encoder decoder model.
        Did hyper parameter tuning and tried to get best results for the given dataset.
        Saved the model in tflite model which can be interpreted in android studio.
        
Phase 4 : App making(2 weeks)
        Learnt on android development.
        Made a chat app for our project.
        Did text preprocessing in java  using the tokens imported as json files.
        Used tflite model to get the results.
